136,done,Auto-increment pain on top task when skipped,"When marking a task done, if it's not the task that 'knecht next' would have suggested, increment pain count on the would-be-next task and note it was skipped in favor of the completed task. This creates automatic skip tracking using the existing pain mechanism. Solves task-122: agents will naturally work on task-8 once it accumulates enough skip-pain. Implementation: cmd_done should call next-task logic, compare to actual task being marked done, and increment pain on skipped task with reason.",,
