126,open,Agent said 'I'll note it but not create a task yet' instead of creating task immediately,"Pain point: During task-20 reflection, agent encountered dependency tracking pain but said 'I'll note it but not create a task yet (following the pain-driven development rule of waiting until pain count ~3-5)'. User corrected: 'How would future agents know about it if you don't create a task. Task creation should happen immediately, that's how we track pain.' Agent misunderstood pain-driven development: Tasks should be created IMMEDIATELY when pain is felt (to track and count it). The 3-5 pain count threshold is for IMPLEMENTING the feature, not for creating the task. Solutions: (1) Clarify this in .rules file under Pain-Driven Feature Development, (2) Add to reflection prompt: 'Did you feel pain? Create a task NOW', (3) Make it explicit: create task immediately, implement at pain count 3-5. Pain count: 1 - agent tried to defer task creation during task-20 reflection.",,
