132,open,Agent says 'worth tracking' or 'should note' but doesn't create task,"Pattern observed during task-116 post-commit discussion. Agent wrote 'This is a pattern worth tracking - when an agent adds any dependency, it should be a deliberate decision with clear justification' but didn't immediately create a task for it. Similarly said things are 'worth tracking' during reflection but only created tasks after user pointed it out twice. Root cause: Agent treats creating tasks as optional follow-up rather than immediate action. The reflection prompt explicitly says 'Create tasks NOW, don't just note it' but agent still defaults to noting in prose. Fix: When agent writes phrases like 'worth tracking', 'should note', 'pattern to watch', 'important lesson', etc., that's a signal to STOP and create a task immediately before continuing. Related to task-107 (agents ignoring reflection prompts).
