206,open,"Subtasks should inherit pain/priority from parents When we file subtasks, they get pain count 0 and end up deprioritized vs unrelated tasks. This implicitly resets priority when breaking down work. Example: We were working on a high-priority task, filed subtasks, and then 'knecht next' suggested unrelated meta tasks instead of the subtasks we just filed. Possible solutions: (1) Subtasks inherit parent's pain count, (2) Subtasks get parent's pain count + 1, (3) Different priority mechanism for subtasks, (4) Explicit priority field separate from pain count. Need to think through what priority semantics we actually want.",,1,
