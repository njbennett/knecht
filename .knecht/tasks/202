202,open,Agent does reflection analysis but doesn't record pain instances when issues already have tasks,"Problem: During task-200, agent ran 'knecht done', saw reflection prompt, analyzed the issues, concluded 'this is covered by task-152' and 'that's covered by task-199', then said 'Should I prepare a commit message?' without actually incrementing pain counts or filing the new task-201. Only after user said 'Yes. Then file tasks for the issues you identified' did agent go back and increment pain on task-152, task-199, and create task-201. Root cause: Agent treats reflection as 'check if already tracked' rather than 'record pain instance NOW'. When agent finds existing task, they rationalize 'oh this is already captured' instead of immediately running 'knecht pain task-N'. The reflection prompt says 'Create tasks NOW' but doesn't say 'Record pain instances NOW even if task exists'. Related to task-107 (agents ignore reflection), task-145 (rewrite prompt), task-48 (make reflection actionable). Solution: Reflection prompt should explicitly say: For EVERY issue you identify: (1) If no task exists, create one NOW, (2) If task exists, increment pain NOW with specific instance details, (3) Don't just note it or conclude it's already covered.
Pain: Agent identified friction tracked by task-71 and task-77 but didn't add pain - user had to redirect",1,
