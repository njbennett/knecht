182,open,Refactor: Consolidate duplicate blocker-reading logic,"Duplicated Code smell: Functions to read blockers file exist in both main.rs (get_blockers_for_task, get_tasks_blocked_by) and task.rs (get_blockers_for_task). The task.rs version uses FileSystem trait for testability, but main.rs versions directly call fs::read_to_string. Extract Method: Move blocker-reading logic to task.rs with FileSystem trait, then have main.rs call those functions via RealFileSystem. This centralizes the logic and makes it all testable. See task-181 where I duplicated this code.",,
