dtvjdi,open,/reflect skill lacks clear local vs upstream filing guidance,"From storytime while adding tasks via /journal: Agent encountered friction (CLAUDE.md missing knecht add/pain docs). During /reflect, agent filed task-495bl0 in storytime first, then user had to prompt 'there's a /upstream skill'. Agent then invoked /upstream and nearly filed a duplicate task before user intervened. The /reflect skill has Section 5 'Upstream Feedback' but: (1) it's at the end after the agent has already filed locally in Section 4, (2) it says 'also invoke /upstream' implying it's additive not instead-of, (3) no clear decision tree for 'is this a knecht bug or a project bug'. Result: agent filed in wrong place, created noise, required user correction.",,"/reflect skill clearly directs agents to: (1) file project-specific tasks locally, (2) file knecht-related friction via /upstream, with decision criteria that prevent filing in the wrong place first"
