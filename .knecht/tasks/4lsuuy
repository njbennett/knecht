4lsuuy,open,Misleading error when claiming task without acceptance criteria,"Running 'cw task-165' shows 'error: Failed to claim task-165. Task may not exist or may be blocked.' but the actual reason is the task has no acceptance criteria. The error message doesn't mention this - user has to guess or dig into the code. Error should say something like 'Task task-165 cannot be claimed: missing acceptance criteria. Run knecht update task-165 -a ""..."" to add criteria.'
Pain: User confused by 'Task may not exist or may be blocked' when actual issue was missing acceptance criteria",1,
