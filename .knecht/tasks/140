140,open,Improve task descriptions to be more explicit about requirements,"Task-136 description said 'increment pain on top task when skipped' but didn't clearly specify that 'top task' means 'oldest open task by ID'. I initially implemented it as 'whatever knecht next suggests' which was wrong. User had to ask 'Why are we incrementing pain on task-111 instead of task-8?' Task descriptions should be more explicit about technical requirements, especially when there are multiple reasonable interpretations.",,
