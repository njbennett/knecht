Add a way for agents to claim/start tasks to signal they're actively working on them.,"Pain: knecht next will still show task-39 to other agents even though one agent is working on it - no way to signal in-progress work
Pain: Running knecht next on main branch still suggests task-40 even though another agent is working on it in a worktree
Pain: cw script doesn't indicate to other agents branching off main that a task has been started",3,
