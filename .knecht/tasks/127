127,done,Agent doesn't recognize that agent confusion about knecht workflow is a knecht UX problem,"Meta pain point: When agent misunderstood pain-driven development (task-126), agent didn't recognize this as a knecht interface/output problem. Agent said 'This is a misunderstanding of the pain-driven development process on my part, not a knecht issue.' But it IS a knecht issue - if agents consistently misunderstand the workflow, knecht's output/prompts/documentation need improvement. Pattern: Agent externalizes blame ('I misunderstood') instead of recognizing UX failure ('knecht wasn't clear enough'). This is especially problematic for agent-first design - if the primary users (agents) are confused, the interface needs fixing. Solutions: (1) Make reflection prompt more explicit about immediate task creation, (2) Add workflow reminders to knecht output, (3) Agent should assume confusion = UX problem until proven otherwise. Pain count: 1 - agent didn't create task for workflow clarity issue during task-20 reflection, had to be prompted by user with this meta-observation.",,
