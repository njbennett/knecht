220,open,"Prompt to close dependent tasks when blocker implements their feature When a blocker task (like task-211) actually implements the feature requested by a blocked task (task-37), the blocked task should also be marked done. Currently nothing prompts this, leading to stale tasks being suggested by 'knecht next'. Consider: 1) detecting when blocker completion might fulfill blocked tasks, 2) prompting to review/close blocked tasks when their blocker is done.",,,
