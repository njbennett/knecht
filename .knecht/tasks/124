124,open,Add 'knecht stop' command to pause work on a task,"Pain point: Agent tried to use 'knecht stop task-8' to stop working on one task before starting another, but command doesn't exist. Currently no formal way to 'stop' working on a task without marking it done. Workaround: just start a different task (implicit context switch). May not be needed if tasks are short-lived, but track pain. Pain count: 1 - tried to stop task-8 before starting task-20.",,
