196,open,Bug: 'knecht next' returns different blocked tasks for different users,"Problem: When user ran 'knecht next', they got task-143. When agent ran 'knecht next', agent got task-176. Both were wrong (both had open blockers). Task-195 fixed the recursive blocker handling. Need to verify if this issue is also resolved now, or if there's still non-deterministic behavior. If resolved by task-195, close this as duplicate/fixed. If not, investigate further: (1) Check if both using same binary/code, (2) Check if task ordering in file affects results.",,
