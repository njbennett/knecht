hpao14,open,Agent uses knecht CLI directly instead of /knecht skill,From storytime while working on task-161h2a (Sentry error fix): Agent ran 'knecht show task-161h2a' directly instead of using the /knecht skill. User had to redirect with 'use the /knecht skill for interacting with knecht'. The skill provides better guidance and context but agents may not know to use it.,,"Agents use /knecht skill by default when interacting with knecht, either through documentation, skill auto-invocation, or CLI guidance"
