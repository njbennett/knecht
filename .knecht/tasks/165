165,done,Cross-project feedback loop for knecht improvements,"Pain: When using knecht to work on Project X, agents identify knecht improvements and track them in Project X's .knecht/tasks file. These improvement ideas never make it back to knecht's own development. Example: storytime agent created knecht improvement tasks in storytime's knecht list, which won't be worked on because agents working on storytime don't have context for knecht development. Problem: No mechanism to funnel insights from knecht usage back to knecht's task list. This is a meta-problem about how to capture and route improvement suggestions discovered during real usage. Possible approaches: 1) Manual process/workflow documentation, 2) Command like 'knecht feedback' that exports tasks, 3) Centralized knecht improvement tracking across projects, 4) Something else? Pain instance: Discoverability issue found in storytime project again, manually had to come to knecht project to increment pain
Pain: User manually copy-pasting questions between StoryTime agent and knecht agent to share discovered UX issues
Pain: Copying /reflect output from other project into knecht journal session is manual and annoying",4,
