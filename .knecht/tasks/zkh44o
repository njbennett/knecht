zkh44o,open,Bug: 'knecht next' tiebreaker uses lexicographic ID instead of task age,"When multiple tasks have equal pain counts, the tiebreaker should prefer older tasks (to avoid starvation). Currently it uses lexicographic ID ordering, which with alphanumeric IDs like 'task-21tku7' produces arbitrary results unrelated to age. The old numeric sequential IDs happened to correlate with age, masking this bug.",,"'knecht next' with equal-pain tasks returns the oldest task by creation time, not the lexicographically smallest ID"
