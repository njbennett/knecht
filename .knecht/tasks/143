143,open,Add verification/review step before marking tasks done,"Problem: task-122 was marked done but wasn't actually finished - the problem it was trying to solve still existed. I also marked task-136 done before manually verifying it worked. Root cause: agents mark tasks done prematurely without verifying the work actually solves the problem. Solution: Add a reviewer/verification step, similar to task-112 (reflector agent). Could be: (1) Checklist in 'knecht done' output requiring confirmation, (2) Separate 'knecht verify task-N' command that checks criteria before allowing 'done', (3) Automated reviewer that validates: tests pass, manual verification done, actual problem solved, commits made. Related to task-139 (manual verification prompt) and task-112 (reflector agent concept).",3,
