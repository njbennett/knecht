155,open,Add 'superseded by' relationship when closing tasks,"When marking a task done that we're not actually implementing, knecht should prompt 'Is this superseded by another task? (task-N or skip)'. This makes task relationships explicit and helps track why work was deferred. Example: task-150 was superseded by task-152. Currently this relationship only exists in the done description, not in structured data. Pain instance: User had to explain that task-150 is obviated by task-152.",,
