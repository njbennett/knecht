197,open,'knecht next' should explain why it suggests a task,"Problem: When 'knecht next' returns a task, there's no visibility into why that specific task was chosen. During task-195, when I got task-176 (which had blockers), I had to run 'knecht show task-176' to discover it had blockers and realize there was a bug. Better UX: 'knecht next' output should explain its reasoning: 'Suggesting task-176 because: highest pain count (3), no open blockers'. Or if following blocker chain: 'Suggesting task-184 because: leaf task blocking task-176 (which blocks task-143 with pain count 3)'. This makes it easier to debug knecht's logic and understand workflow. Related to agent-first design principle.",,
