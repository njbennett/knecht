201,open,Add version command to help diagnose stale binary issues,"Problem: During task-200, installed binary showed wrong behavior (task-143 instead of task-184), but I initially suspected a logic bug rather than stale binary. No easy way to check if installed binary matches source. Solution: Add 'knecht version' command showing: (1) version/build timestamp, (2) git commit hash if available, (3) optionally: whether running from /usr/local/bin vs cargo run. This would make it obvious when binary is stale. Related to task-152 (post-commit hook) and recurring stale binary issues (tasks 150-151, 200).",1,
