174,open,Inconsistent task ID validation across commands,"cmd_delete validates that task_id.parse::<u32>() succeeds before calling library function, but cmd_done, cmd_show, cmd_start, cmd_pain, and cmd_update do not. This leads to inconsistent error messages for invalid task IDs (e.g., 'knecht delete abc' vs 'knecht done abc'). Should either: 1) All commands validate upfront (consistent UX), 2) No commands validate (let library handle it), or 3) Document why delete is special. Discovered during task-118 reflection. Refactoring: Make Error Handling Consistent (related to Extract Method pattern from task-119).",,
