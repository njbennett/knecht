207,open,Consider closing task-30 (Extract TaskSerializer) - CSV library eliminated need,"Task-30 suggested extracting a TaskSerializer class for format parsing/writing. With task-49 complete, we now use the csv crate which handles serialization. The 'extract serializer' refactoring may no longer be needed since csv::Reader and csv::Writer are already extracted, well-tested serializers. Review task-30 and either close it or update it to reflect CSV-specific refactoring opportunities.",,
