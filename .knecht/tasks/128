128,open,"Agents put pain count in description instead of title, making it invisible in list output","Pain point: When creating tasks, agents consistently put 'pain count: N' in the description field instead of the title. Problem: 'knecht list' only shows titles, so pain counts are invisible unless you run 'knecht show task-N' on each task individually. This defeats the purpose of pain tracking for prioritization. Examples: task-123, task-124, task-125, task-126, task-127 all have pain counts buried in descriptions. This is an agent behavior issue caused by knecht's interface design. Solutions: (1) Add formal pain_count field to task format, (2) Show first line of description in 'knecht list' output (task-100), (3) Add 'knecht list --sort-by-pain' command, (4) Make 'knecht list' show pain count column if present in title/description. Root cause: Agents naturally put detailed context in descriptions, but knecht doesn't expose descriptions in primary interface (list command). Related to task-100. Pain count: 1 - all 5 tasks created today (123-127) have invisible pain counts.",,
