125,open,Agent doesn't commit immediately after completing task,"Pain point: After finishing task-20 and responding to reflection prompt, agent asked 'should we proceed with task-8?' instead of committing. User had to explicitly say 'Nope. Make a commit.' The .rules file says 'Commit .knecht/tasks with code changes' but agent skipped this step. Pattern: Agent treats commit as optional/asks permission instead of following workflow. Solutions: (1) Make commit reminder more prominent in 'knecht done' output, (2) Add to reflection prompt questions, (3) Could 'knecht done' block until commit is made (too aggressive?). Pain count: 1 - had to remind agent to commit after task-20.",,
