199,open,Add debugging/inspection commands to prevent agents bypassing knecht interface,"Problem: During task-195 debugging, I used grep/cat to inspect .knecht/tasks and .knecht/blockers directly instead of using knecht commands. Why? I wanted to: (1) See raw blockers file format, (2) Check specific task IDs quickly, (3) Debug knecht's own logic. This violates agent-first principle - if knecht's commands aren't sufficient for debugging knecht itself, that's a UX problem. Solutions: (1) Add 'knecht debug task-N' showing raw data format and all relationships, (2) Add 'knecht inspect blockers' showing blockers file with explanation, (3) Make .rules MORE emphatic about never reading files directly, especially during debugging - that's when dogfooding matters most, (4) Add 'knecht search <pattern>' for pattern matching. Goal: Make knecht commands MORE useful than raw file access for any workflow, including debugging. Related to task-111 (agents read files directly, pain count 4).
Pain: Had to read .knecht/blockers directly to debug why task-178 was suggested by knecht next. No command exists to view blocker relationships.",2,
