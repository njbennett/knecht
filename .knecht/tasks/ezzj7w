ezzj7w,open,Eliminate messy merge conflicts from task file updates,"Current .knecht/tasks conflates schema (field structure), content (task details), and activity (pain instances) into a single file.

See subtasks for specific approaches.
Pain: Schema change (adding acceptance_criteria field) caused 500+ line conflict across 7 conflict blocks - entire file conflicted because every line changed format

Pain: Resolving rebase conflict required Grep for markers + Read with offset due to file size - agent tooling struggles with monolithic file",4,
