198,open,Add protection against circular blocker dependencies,"Problem: The new recursive blocker logic in find_best_blocker() could infinite loop if there are circular dependencies (e.g., task-1 blocks task-2, task-2 blocks task-1). This would be a data integrity issue, but we should handle it gracefully. Solution options: (1) Track visited tasks in recursion and detect cycles, return error if found, (2) Add max recursion depth limit, (3) Add 'knecht check' command to validate blocker relationships have no cycles. Consider: Should we prevent circular blockers at creation time (in 'block' command)? Or just detect them later? Related to task-195 (recursive blocker fix) and task-110 (task ID validation).",,
