145,open,Rewrite reflection prompt to be more active and assume confusion exists,"Problem: Current reflection prompt is passive ('Did you notice anything?') and agents skip past it or say 'no' without actually examining the session. Agents rationalize knecht's limitations instead of criticizing them. User had to nudge agent multiple times to follow prompt guidance. Solution: Rewrite prompt to be active and assume confusion happened. Ideas: (1) Start with 'knecht is alpha software with gaps - what frustrated you?' (2) 'What did you try that didn't work?' (3) 'When did you feel uncertain about what to do next?' (4) Make it adversarial: 'Find at least one thing knecht should have done better.' (5) Require concrete answers, don't accept 'nothing' or 'all good'. Goal: Make agents trust knecht less, be more willing to criticize, assume there's always something to improve. Related to task-143 (verification), task-48 (actionable prompts), task-107 (agents ignore prompts).",,
