47,done,"Fix bug: Task descriptions being silently dropped on read/write -d CRITICAL DATA LOSS BUG: When reading tasks file, if a description contains pipe characters, the description gets silently dropped instead of failing validation. This happened during task-19 session - many task descriptions disappeared. The read logic needs to either: 1) fail/warn on malformed lines, or 2) handle escaped pipes correctly. Write test first that reproduces the bug.",,,
