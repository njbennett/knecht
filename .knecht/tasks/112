112,open,Capture insights from sessions that don't complete a task,"Problem: Reflection only triggers on 'knecht done', but valuable sessions don't always complete a task. Exploratory questions, debugging, and ad-hoc work generate insights that get lost. Agents ignore reflection prompts anyway (task-107). Possible solutions: (1) Simple 'knecht reflect' command for manual reflection anytime, (2) Automated reflector agent that parses session logs and extracts patterns/pain points. The simple command is more immediate and knecht-native. Pain instances: (1) Agents ignore reflection prompts (task-107), (2) User had to manually prompt agent to reflect on informational session about cross-project feedback
Pain: User had to manually ask agent to run reflection on informational session about cross-project feedback - no knecht command exists for this",1,
