115,open,Agent over-designed solution - should question necessity before adding complexity,"Anti-pattern observed in task-114: Agent tried multiple complex solutions (mutexes, cargo config, subprocess compilation) before user asked 'Why not just remove the wrappers?' The right answer was DELETE CODE, not add complexity. Pattern: Agent was in 'fix the test' mode instead of 'question if we need the test' mode. This violates YAGNI and pain-driven development principles. Refactoring: Need better heuristics/prompts for when to SIMPLIFY vs when to ADD. Related to task-104 (agent over-engineering during task-50). Pain count should track how often agents add unnecessary complexity.",,
