122,done,Agent keeps choosing something other than the primary feature in the task list,"Pattern observed: When asked 'What next?', agent consistently avoids task-8 (Switch storytime project from beads to knecht) which is the primary migration task, and instead suggests tangential improvements like documentation, refactoring, or minor features. Task-8 has 1 open blocker (task-20: document beads uninstall) but agent doesn't mention this or offer to complete the blocker. Instead agent suggests task-36, task-100, task-113, etc. This happens even though task-8 is clearly the main objective. Possible causes: (1) Agent prefers small, well-defined tasks over larger migration work, (2) Agent doesn't recognize task-8 as primary goal, (3) Agent avoids tasks with blockers without explicitly addressing them, (4) Agent bias toward 'polish' work over 'shipping' work. Impact: User has to redirect agent to primary work. If this continues (pain count 2+), need to: add priority/importance field to tasks, or add explicit 'primary objective' marker, or improve agent instructions to focus on unblocking and completing primary features before suggesting improvements.",3,
