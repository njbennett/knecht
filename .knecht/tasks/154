154,open,Tasks should include acceptance criteria,"Problem: Tasks are filed with titles and descriptions of the problem, but don't specify how we'll know when the work is done. This leads to ambiguity and rework. Example: task-149 description said 'guide should include this step' but didn't specify WHAT success looks like (a test? documentation change? both?). Solution: 1) Add 'Acceptance Criteria' section to task descriptions (could be a convention or enforced format), 2) Update .rules to remind agents to check for acceptance criteria before starting work ('how will we know when this work is done?'), 3) Reflection prompt should ask 'Did this task have clear acceptance criteria? If not, what would have helped?' Related to task-148 (explicit task descriptions). This is about making task completion criteria testable/verifiable.",1,
