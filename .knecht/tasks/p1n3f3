p1n3f3,open,Agent didn't use /upstream skill until user prompted,"From storytime while investigating room auth bug: Reflection prompt instructs /upstream for knecht improvements when in another project (section 5), but agent used 'knecht add' instead. User asked 'Why didn't you use upstream skill?'. Root cause: /upstream instruction comes AFTER the 'REQUIRED ACTION' section where agent decides what to do. By the time agent processes section 5, they've already committed to an action. Fix: integrate /upstream into the decision tree in section 4, or add explicit gate ('If not in knecht project, use /upstream instead').",,"Reflection prompt makes /upstream instruction more prominent (e.g., bold, separate section, or earlier in the prompt)"
