4yp5xw,done,One file per task storage format,"Store each task in its own file (.knecht/tasks/task-ezzj7w or similar) instead of one monolithic .knecht/tasks file. Benefits: parallel task creation never conflicts, pain updates to different tasks never conflict, schema changes only affect new writes, natural git history per task. Trade-offs: more filesystem operations, 'knecht list' reads N files, migration needed. Part of task-ezzj7w (eliminate merge conflicts).
Pain: Rebasing journal branch required resolving conflicts in monolithic tasks file - if each task were its own file, parallel changes to different tasks would never conflict",1,
