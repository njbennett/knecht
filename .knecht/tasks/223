223,open,Agents should check for untracked/uncommitted work from other sessions before committing,"When preparing a commit, agents should run 'git status' and check for untracked files or uncommitted changes that may be from other sessions. If found, ask the user what to do rather than ignoring them or accidentally including them. This prevents: 1) Leaving orphaned files from other sessions, 2) Accidentally committing unrelated work, 3) Losing track of work-in-progress from parallel sessions.",,
