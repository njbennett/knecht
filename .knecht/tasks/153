153,done,Integration test file is large and hard to navigate,"tests/integration_test.rs is now 1990+ lines with 79+ test functions. When reading it with read_file, I get an outline instead of content, which requires knowing line numbers to read specific sections. This makes it hard to find existing tests or understand test patterns. Solutions: 1) Split into multiple test files by feature area (migration tests, command tests, error handling, etc), 2) Add module structure within integration tests, 3) Document test organization in comments at top of file. Pain point: Had to use line numbers to navigate when adding migration_guide_mentions_beads2knecht_build test.
Pain: Integration test file is 3600+ lines. Had to use grep to navigate when adding delivered task visual marker test.
Pain: File now exceeds 40869 tokens - can't read it at all without offset/limit, had to use line ranges to resolve merge conflicts
Pain: Had to read integration_test.rs in portions due to 3712 lines (40k tokens exceeded read limit)
Pain: During task-250, had to read integration tests in chunks with offset/limit. Could not read full file to understand test patterns. Made updating tests slower and more error-prone.",4,
