157,open,Agent edited .knecht/tasks file directly and invented 'wontdo' status,"Pain: User asked to mark task-151 as won't-do. knecht only supports 'open' and 'done' statuses. Agent used sed to manually edit .knecht/tasks and changed status to 'wontdo'. This bypasses knecht's data model and could cause issues. Solutions: 1) Add 'knecht wontdo task-N' command with proper 'wontdo' status, 2) Use 'done' for won't-do tasks and document in description, 3) Add other statuses (cancelled, blocked, etc.), 4) Keep it simple with just open/done and document won't-do in task description. Consider: Does adding more statuses violate YAGNI? What's the pain count for needing won't-do status?",,
