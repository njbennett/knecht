142,open,Extract Method: skip tracking logic from mark_task_done_with_fs,"The skip tracking logic in mark_task_done_with_fs (lines 281-297) is a distinct responsibility: determine if skip happened, find the skipped task, increment pain, add description. This is 'Long Method' smell - function now does: find oldest task, mark done, track skips, write tasks. Consider extracting to record_skip_if_needed(tasks, completed_task_id, oldest_task_id) or as a method on Task. Related to task-131 (refactor write_tasks format logic).",,
