113,open,"Fix: -d flag in task title wasn't parsed correctly Task-47 has '-d CRITICAL DATA LOSS BUG: ...' in its title, which shows the -d flag wasn't parsed. The agent likely ran something like 'knecht add ""Fix bug: Task descriptions being silently dropped"" -d ""CRITICAL DATA LOSS BUG...""' but the CLI parser didn't recognize -d as a flag. Current implementation may require -d to come before the title, or maybe -d parsing is broken. Need to: (1) Check current arg parsing logic in cmd_add, (2) Write test for 'knecht add TITLE -d DESCRIPTION', (3) Fix if broken, or document correct usage in error messages.",,,
