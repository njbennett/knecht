219,done,Figure out how to get agents using knecht to consistently start work in a new git worktree for parallel agent execution,"## Problem
Claude sessions can't effectively manage worktrees themselves - shell doesn't persist cd, so must prefix every command with path.

## Solution
User-run wrapper script that:
1. Creates worktree with timestamped branch: git worktree add ../repo-work -b work-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS
2. cd into worktree
3. Run claude (blocks until exit)
4. On claude exit (any reason - quit, /clear, crash):
   - Check for uncommitted changes → warn and abort if dirty
   - Check if any commits on branch → skip merge if none
   - git fetch origin && git rebase main
   - cd to main worktree && git merge --ff-only branch
   - git worktree remove ../repo-work
   - git branch -d branch

## Edge Cases
- Uncommitted changes: abort cleanup, warn user, leave worktree intact
- Rebase conflicts: abort cleanup, warn user, leave worktree intact  
- No commits made: just cleanup worktree, no merge needed
- Main moved during session: rebase handles it, conflicts possible

## Interface
Shell function or script: cw [branch-name]
- If branch-name provided, use it; otherwise generate timestamp
- Could live in user's dotfiles or be a knecht subcommand
Pain: User had to manually create worktree and start Claude session for task-39 - wants knecht start task-id to automate this
Pain: User thought they'd created separate worktrees for 2 agents but both ended up in same directory - worktree setup is error-prone without automation
