162,open,Improve command discoverability for agents,"Pain: Agent in storytime project didn't know about 'knecht update' command because they started with 'knecht next', which doesn't show available commands. The agent resorted to editing .knecht/tasks directly. Possible solutions: 1) Make 'knecht next' show available commands in its output, 2) Add 'knecht help' or 'knecht commands', 3) Ensure agents see command list early in workflow. Related to agent-first design principle - agents need to discover what knecht can do programmatically. Pain instance: Agent didn't know knecht commands existed, exact same issue as original pain instance
Pain: Bug report: Agent edited .knecht/tasks directly to delete task instead of running 'knecht delete'. Didn't try 'knecht --help' to discover available commands.",3,
