3keuzd,open,Agent doesn't proactively start working when task context is provided,"From storytime while working on task-c39jvr: Agent was spawned on task branch in plan mode, with task context available, but waited for user to explicitly say 'plan task-c39jvr' instead of proactively reading the task and starting work. The cw script provides context (task-235, task-243 done) but agent behavior doesn't use it.",,"When agent is started on a task-N branch in plan mode, it reads the task from .knecht/tasks and begins planning without user prompting"
