249,open,Bug: cw script doesn't launch Claude session when rebase conflicts occur,"task-244 implemented conflict resolution by launching Claude (scripts/cw lines 144-177), but Claude doesn't actually launch when conflicts occur. User confirmed Claude doesn't launch. Need to: 1) Add debug output to identify where script fails, 2) Investigate if subshell environment/PATH/working directory prevents Claude launch, 3) Test the conflict detection and Claude invocation path.",,
