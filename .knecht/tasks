100|open|Show descriptions in list output The 'knecht list' command only shows ID and title. When tasks have descriptions, there's no way to see them without reading the file directly. This makes it hard to understand task context. Possible solutions: add --verbose flag, show first line of description, or add 'knecht show task-N' command.
101|open|Add command to list done tasks Currently 'knecht list' only shows open tasks. There's no way to see completed tasks or verify a task was marked done. Need 'knecht list --done' or 'knecht list --all' to show task history.
102|open|Refactor: Extract Method on test helper setup/teardown Multiple tests repeat the pattern of setup_temp_dir() / run_command() / cleanup_temp_dir(). This is a 'Duplicated Code' smell. Consider 'Extract Method' to create test_in_temp_dir(test_fn) helper that handles setup/teardown. See tests/integration_test.rs.
103|open|Consider simplifying FileSystem trait The FileSystem trait has 5 methods. RealFileSystem is just thin wrappers. This adds indirection without much benefit for production code. Consider 'Inline Class' - could we make the trait internal to tests only? Or is the testability benefit worth the complexity? Track pain points.
104|open|Agent over-engineered solution before user intervention During task-50 (coverage work), agent added FileSystem trait + dependency injection + TestFileSystem (~130 lines) which temporarily LOWERED coverage to 90% because test infrastructure itself had uncovered branches. Agent then tried to use coverage(off) attributes. User had to ask 'Could you write tests for the test code?' to highlight the meta-problem. Only after user pushed back with 'Do we still need the nullables?' did agent properly justify the approach. Problem: Agent didn't pause to validate complexity was necessary before implementing. Agent should have: (1) Explained the tradeoff upfront (2) Asked if user wanted this approach (3) Started with simplest solution. The dependency injection WAS ultimately needed for 100% coverage, but the journey revealed agent needs better complexity-checking behavior.
