47|done|Fix bug: Task descriptions being silently dropped on read/write -d CRITICAL DATA LOSS BUG: When reading tasks file, if a description contains pipe characters, the description gets silently dropped instead of failing validation. This happened during task-19 session - many task descriptions disappeared. The read logic needs to either: 1) fail/warn on malformed lines, or 2) handle escaped pipes correctly. Write test first that reproduces the bug.
48|open|Make reflection prompt more actionable for agents -d The 'knecht done' reflection prompt asks good questions but agents (including me) ignore it and move on. Need to make it more actionable: 1) Could pause and wait for response, 2) Could be more explicit ('Answer these questions before continuing'), 3) Could be formatted differently to stand out. Pain: Agent (me) just skipped right past reflection prompt after task-19 without responding.
