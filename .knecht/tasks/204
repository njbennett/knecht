204,open,Distinguish between 'skipped' pain and 'real' pain,"Currently pain count increments when tasks are skipped, but this doesn't mean the task itself is painful - it might just be low priority. Consider tracking 'skip count' separately from 'pain count'. Pain should represent 'I tried to do X and it hurt', not 'I chose to do Y instead'. Skips accumulating doesn't necessarily mean a task should be done - it might mean it should be deleted or deprioritized.",,
