130,open,Agent added unnecessary dependency when simpler solution existed,"During task-116, agent initially implemented pain count parsing using regex crate, requiring new dependency. User caught this immediately because they knew the feature didn't need external dependencies. Root cause: Agent reached for familiar/comfortable solution (regex) without considering if built-in string operations were sufficient. Pattern: Adding dependencies should trigger question 'Does this really need a dependency?' Learning: (1) Prefer std library over dependencies when possible, (2) User catching unnecessary dependency is a signal that agent didn't think critically about the solution, (3) Before adding ANY dependency, explicitly justify why std library is insufficient. Related to task-116.",,
