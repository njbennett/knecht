193,open,'knecht done' reflection prompt should explicitly remind agents to commit after reflecting,"Problem: Agent completed task-183 and saw reflection prompt but didn't follow through with reflection + commit until user reminded them. The reflection prompt asks questions but doesn't explicitly say 'After reflecting, prepare a commit.' Solution: Add a final line to reflection prompt: 'After creating any needed tasks above, prepare to commit your changes (git add + git commit).' This makes the workflow explicit: reflect → file tasks → commit. Related to task-167 (move workflow guidance to command output).",,
