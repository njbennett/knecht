168,open,Agent read .knecht/tasks directly instead of using knecht next,"At start of task-11, agent read .knecht/tasks file directly to see what tasks were open. User then asked agent to run 'knecht next' which provided the same information more cleanly. This indicates agents might not know they should use 'knecht next' first. Possible solutions: (1) When knecht commands are run in a fresh session, remind about 'knecht next', (2) Add to .rules that agents should use 'knecht next' before reading files, (3) Make 'knecht list' output suggest using 'knecht next' for recommendations. Pain count: 1 (task-11 session)
Pain: Agent ran knecht next, then read .knecht/tasks directly instead of using knecht start or knecht show

Potential solution: Create a /skill for knecht that teaches agents the correct commands and workflow, preventing them from bypassing the CLI to manipulate task files directly.",2,
