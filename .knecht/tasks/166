166,open,Make 'knecht list' show only open tasks by default,"Pain: The output of 'knecht list' is becoming unwieldy - it shows 165+ tasks including all done tasks. This makes it hard to find actionable work. The default view should show only open tasks that are ready to work on. Add a flag like '--all' or '--done' to see completed tasks when needed. This is especially important for agents who need to quickly see what work is available. Current workaround: scroll through long list or manually filter. Related to task-101 which asked for '--done' flag, but this inverts the default behavior.
