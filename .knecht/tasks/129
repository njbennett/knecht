129,done,Agent invents fake blockers during Mikado Method instead of trying actual change,"During task-127, agent identified 'test brittleness' as a blocker and created task-129 to 'fix' it. But there was no real blocker - the test was correct, and changing the prompt + test together would have worked fine. Agent should TRY the actual change first (step 2 of Mikado Method) before inventing blockers. The Mikado Method says: try it, hit REAL blockers, then revert and address them. Don't invent theoretical blockers without attempting the work. Pain count: 1 (task-127 session, invented task-129 blocker unnecessarily)",,
