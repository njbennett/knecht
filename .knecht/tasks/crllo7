crllo7,open,cw script should auto-claim tasks and handle existing worktrees,"When cw creates a worktree for a task, it should: 1) Auto-run 'knecht start task-N' to claim the task, 2) Check if worktree already exists and offer to resume instead of failing. Currently agents start work without claiming, so knecht next keeps suggesting tasks that are already being worked on, and cw fails with 'Worktree path already exists' when trying to start work on them.
