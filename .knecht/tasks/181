181,done,Fix 'knecht next' to prefer unblocked subtasks over parent tasks,"Problem: When task-143 has 5 open subtasks (176-180) with task-175 (blocker) completed, 'knecht next' still suggests task-143 instead of its subtasks. This prevents proper incremental work on large tasks. Root cause: find_next_task_with_fs() only looks at pain count and age, doesn't consider blocker/subtask relationships. Solution: Update next logic to: (1) Check if suggested task has open subtasks, (2) If yes, recursively find the best subtask to work on instead, (3) Only suggest parent when all subtasks are done or blocked. This ensures agents work bottom-up on task hierarchies. Related to task-143 (verification workflow) which revealed this issue.",1,
