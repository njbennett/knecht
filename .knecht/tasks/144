144,open,Add reflective prompt when commands receive unrecognized flags or arguments,"Problem: When agent tried 'knecht pain task-143 -d ""reason""', the -d flag was silently ignored. Agent rationalized this instead of recognizing it as missing functionality. Solution: When knecht receives unrecognized flags/args, show a prompt: 'It looks like you tried to use [flag/argument]. What were you trying to accomplish? Consider: (1) Is this a new feature knecht should have? File a task describing the behavior. (2) Does a task already exist for this? Search and increment its pain count.' This turns confusion into actionable feedback without knecht having to guess intent. Related to task-117 (pain -d flag) and reflection prompt design.",,
