261,open,Implement /mikado skill for time-boxed task attempts,"A Claude Code skill that implements the Mikado Method for tackling complex tasks. The method helps avoid getting stuck on prerequisites by time-boxing attempts and systematically identifying blockers.

## Recommendation: Skill (not agent mode)
A skill is more appropriate because:
- It modifies *how* the agent approaches a task, not what tools it has access to
- It can be invoked on-demand when the user wants Mikado-style work
- It integrates with the existing task system (knecht)

## Skill Behavior

### When invoked: `/mikado <task-description>`

1. **Start timer** - Record session start time

2. **Create attempt plan**
   - Break the task into substeps
   - Each substep gets a time checkpoint

3. **Work on substeps with time checks**
   - After each substep, check if ~15-20 minutes have elapsed
   - If time exceeded:
     - Stop immediately
     - List all blockers/prerequisites identified during the attempt
     - Prompt user to confirm which to file as blocking tasks

4. **On time limit reached**
   - Reset any uncommitted work (git checkout, etc.)
   - File identified prerequisites as knecht tasks with `--blocker-for <current-task>`
   - Mark current task as blocked
   - Reflect: What did we learn? What would we do differently?

5. **On success (task completed within time)**
   - Mark task complete
   - No need to reset or file blockers

## Integration with knecht
- `knecht add --blocker-for <task-id>` - file a task as a blocker (may need to implement)
- `knecht block <task-id> --by <blocker-task-id>` - mark task as blocked
- `knecht unblock <task-id>` - when blocker is resolved

## Key Principles Encoded
1. **Time-boxing prevents rabbit holes** - Forces stopping before going too deep
2. **Reset prevents partial/broken state** - Clean slate for next attempt
3. **Filing blockers creates actionable work** - Prerequisites become their own tasks
4. **Reflection improves future attempts** - Learn from what didn't work

## Pain Points (from task-129)
- Agent invents fake blockers instead of trying actual change first
- During task-127, agent identified 'test brittleness' as a blocker without attempting the work
- The Mikado Method says: try it, hit REAL blockers, then revert and address them
- This skill should enforce 'try first' before allowing blocker identification
Pain: Two sessions running without a plan, causing excessive permission prompts",1,
