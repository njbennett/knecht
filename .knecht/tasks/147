147,open,Research ACP integration for detecting agent tool usage patterns,"Finding: Zed uses Agent Client Protocol (ACP), an open standard for agent-editor communication. ACP has tool call reporting via 'session/update' notifications that agents send to the client. However, this is agent->client reporting, not client monitoring of agent. What we need: Ability for knecht (or a knecht wrapper) to intercept/monitor when agents call tools like read_file, grep, edit_file on .knecht/tasks. Questions to research: (1) Can ACP clients (like Zed) intercept tool calls before execution? (2) Can we write an ACP middleware/proxy that sits between agent and editor? (3) Does Zed expose hooks for monitoring file access? (4) Could we wrap agents in an ACP-compatible layer that adds monitoring? Next: Look at ACP protocol extensibility, check Zed source code for tool call hooks, explore if we can build monitoring into the ACP transport layer. Related to task-146 (pattern detection), task-111 (agents bypassing knecht).",1,
