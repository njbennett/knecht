232,open,Consider bug/urgent flag or severity field - had to increment pain 3x just to prioritize a bug,"Workaround: user asked to increment pain 3 times on a bug task to get it prioritized via knecht next. This suggests pain count alone may not be the right mechanism for urgent bugs. Options: (1) Add bug/urgent flag that auto-boosts priority, (2) Add severity field separate from pain, (3) Trust that bugs naturally accumulate pain quickly, (4) Keep current system - this is rare edge case. Related to task-204 (skipped vs real pain) and general prioritization design.
Pain: User needs way to mark task-258 (merge cleanup bug) as high priority - pain count alone not sufficient for urgent bugs",1,
