218,open,Track skips separately from pain counts,"Currently when 'knecht done' is run on a non-oldest task, the skip is recorded by incrementing the skipped task's pain count and appending 'Skip: task-X completed instead' to its description. This conflates two different concepts: (1) Pain: explicit user feedback that a feature's absence hurts, (2) Skips: automatic tracking of when a task was passed over. These should be tracked separately since they measure different things. Consider adding a skip_count field or separate skip tracking. Related to task-134 which added mandatory pain documentation.",,
