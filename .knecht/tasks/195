195,done,Bug: 'knecht next' doesn't handle trees of blockers correctly,"Problem: We have a blocker tree: task-143 blocked by task-176, task-176 blocked by tasks 184-192. When running 'knecht next': User gets task-143 (which has open blocker task-176), Agent gets task-176 (which has open blockers 184-192). Expected: Both should get one of tasks 184-192 (the unblocked leaf tasks). Current logic in find_next_task_with_fs() checks if best_task has blockers and calls find_best_blocker(), but find_best_blocker() doesn't recursively check if the blocker itself has blockers. It just returns the best blocker, even if that blocker is also blocked. Solution: find_best_blocker() needs to recursively find leaf blockers (blockers with no open blockers of their own). Related to task-181 which attempted to fix this.",,
