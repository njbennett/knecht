f53rxo,open,Agent reflection should distinguish internal code issues from knecht UX issues,"During task-4yp5xw, agent dismissed friction as 'not knecht bugs' because they were internal code structure issues (test updates, comparison logic). But these WERE worth tracking as tasks in THIS repo. The /reflect prompt conflates 'knecht bugs' (UX issues) with 'codebase issues worth tracking'. Should split: /reflect for internal code issues, /upstream for knecht UX feedback.",,Separate /reflect (internal codebase) from /upstream (knecht UX)
