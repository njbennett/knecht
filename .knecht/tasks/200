200,done,Installed knecht binary is stale - shows task-143 instead of task-184,"Problem: 'knecht next' from installed binary shows task-143 (which has open blockers), but 'cargo run -- next' correctly shows task-184 (a leaf blocker). Root cause: Installed binary at /usr/local/bin/knecht is outdated and doesn't have recent blocker logic fixes. This is a recurring issue (tasks 150-152). Need to: (1) Reinstall knecht binary from source, (2) Verify fix works, (3) Consider task-152 (post-commit hook to rebuild binary).",,
