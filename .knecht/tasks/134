134,done,Require -d flag for 'knecht pain' command,"Current behavior: 'knecht pain task-X' just increments the count silently without context. Problem: We lose the documentation of WHY the pain occurred. During task-122 reflection, agent ran 'knecht pain task-123' and 'knecht pain task-118' without documenting what specifically caused the pain. The old manual editing workflow forced documentation; the convenient command makes it too easy to skip. SOLUTION: Make 'knecht pain' require the -d flag: 'knecht pain -t task-X -d ""description of pain instance""'. Running 'knecht pain' without -d should error with usage message. This forces documentation of each pain instance at the time it occurs. Note: task-135 proposes moving task ID to flagged argument (-t/--task) for consistency. Related to task-117 (track source task), task-43 (update command), and task-135 (flagged arguments). Pain instance: During task-30 reflection, had to run 'knecht pain task-103' then separately 'knecht update task-103 -d ...' to add context - two commands when one should suffice.",4,
