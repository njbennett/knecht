121,open,Document TDD pattern for test helpers in rules or knecht output,"Pain point: Agent tried to write new test to demonstrate helper value, but should refactor existing test to use helper (making it fail), then implement helper. This TDD best practice needs to be documented somewhere the agent will see it. Options: 1) Add to .rules file under TDD section, 2) When 'knecht list' shows tasks about test helpers or refactoring, include a hint, 3) Add to reflection prompt questions. Without this, agents will repeat the same mistake every session. Related to agent memory/learning problem - if it's not in rules or knecht output, agents don't remember it.",,
