104,open,"Agent over-engineered solution before user intervention During task-50 (coverage work), agent added FileSystem trait + dependency injection + TestFileSystem (~130 lines) which temporarily LOWERED coverage to 90% because test infrastructure itself had uncovered branches. Agent then tried to use coverage(off) attributes. User had to ask 'Could you write tests for the test code?' to highlight the meta-problem. Only after user pushed back with 'Do we still need the nullables?' did agent properly justify the approach. Problem: Agent didn't pause to validate complexity was necessary before implementing. Agent should have: (1) Explained the tradeoff upfront (2) Asked if user wanted this approach (3) Started with simplest solution. The dependency injection WAS ultimately needed for 100% coverage, but the journey revealed agent needs better complexity-checking behavior.",,,
