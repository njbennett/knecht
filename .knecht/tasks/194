194,open,'knecht next' should warn about uncommitted changes before suggesting next task,"Problem: During task-183, discovered uncommitted work from task-181 when trying to commit. 'knecht next' suggested task-183 without warning about dirty git state. This led to confusion about what to commit. Solution: Before suggesting next task, check git status.

This helps agents maintain clean task boundaries and proper commit hygiene. Related to task-193 (commit workflow guidance).",,
