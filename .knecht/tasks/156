156,open,Agent avoids high-priority tasks with blockers,"Pain: Agent tried to skip task-8 (pain: 5, highest priority) and suggested task-11 (pain: 3) instead, reasoning that task-8's blockers meant it 'shouldn't' do the task. Situation: task-8 has 'Blocked on: task-149, task-150, task-151, task-152' in description. Tasks 149-150 were already done. Agent should have investigated blockers rather than avoiding the task. Hypothesis: Agents pattern-match 'blockers' with 'cannot proceed' rather than 'work to do.' Likely causes: (1) Training bias toward completion/success makes agents avoid tasks with lower probability of quick success, (2) Risk aversion from RLHF penalizing 'spinning wheels', (3) Mimicking human procrastination patterns from training data, (4) Misunderstanding that in Mikado Method, blockers are discovered problems to solve, not stop signs. In pain-driven development, highest pain = highest priority regardless of difficulty.",,
