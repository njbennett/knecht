103,claimed,Consider simplifying FileSystem trait The FileSystem trait has 5 methods. RealFileSystem is just thin wrappers. This adds indirection without much benefit for production code. Consider 'Inline Class' - could we make the trait internal to tests only? Or is the testability benefit worth the complexity? Track pain points.,"The FileSystem trait has 5 methods. RealFileSystem is just thin wrappers. This adds indirection without much benefit for production code. Consider 'Inline Class' - could we make the trait internal to tests only? Or is the testability benefit worth the complexity? Track pain points. Pain instance: While extracting CsvSerializer (task-30), noticed FileSystem trait is now the main remaining complexity in task.rs - mixing I/O abstraction with business logic. The serializer extraction highlighted this separation-of-concerns issue.",1,
