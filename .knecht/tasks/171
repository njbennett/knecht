171,open,"Agents misunderstand pain-driven development: implement at 3-5, but CREATE TASK at pain=1","During task-11 reflection, agent said 'pain count = 1, so not worth a task yet' and didn't create a task. User corrected: 'If you don't create a task in this session then we won't ever see if there are more instances.' The confusion: Tasks should be created IMMEDIATELY when pain is felt (to track and count it). The 3-5 pain count threshold is for IMPLEMENTING the feature, not for creating the task. This needs to be clarified in .rules file or made more prominent in knecht's reflection prompt. Without immediate task creation, pain tracking doesn't work because there's no task to increment. Pain count: 1 (task-11 session). Note: This is similar to task-126 but from a different angle - task-126 was about agents deferring task creation, this is about agents misunderstanding the threshold.",,
