169,done,Tasks lack acceptance criteria when created - should prompt or auto-generate them,"During task-11, user had to tell agent to start by writing acceptance criteria. The task itself (created earlier) had no acceptance criteria defined. This is a workflow gap: tasks are created with just title/description, but before starting work, acceptance criteria should be defined. IMPLEMENTATION: (1) Added acceptance_criteria field to Task struct, (2) Added -a flag to knecht add, (3) Added --acceptance-criteria to knecht update, (4) knecht show displays criteria. STILL NEEDED: knecht start should check for acceptance criteria and fail if missing.
Pain: StoryTime agent read .knecht/tasks directly because task had empty description - no context to work from
Pain: Acceptance criteria 'Output should guide user to verification workflow' was misinterpreted as deliver command output guidance rather than verification workflow guidance",4,
