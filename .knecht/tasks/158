158,open,Agent should prepare commit after reflection prompt,"Pain: After completing a task (task-151) and responding to the reflection prompt (which resulted in filing task-156, task-157, and incrementing pain on task-48), the user had to explicitly tell the agent to commit the task file. The agent should automatically: 1) Show the git diff of .knecht/tasks, 2) Prepare a commit message summarizing the changes, 3) Ask user for approval before committing. This follows the .rules guidance: 'IMPORTANT: Always confirm with user before running git commit. Present the changes that will be committed and ask for approval.' The agent had the data (task-151 done, new tasks filed, pain incremented) but didn't proactively prepare the commit. Related to task-48 (reflection prompt effectiveness) - the reflection workflow should include commit preparation as a natural next step.
Pain: Agent tried to commit directly instead of going through knecht done reflection first",1,
