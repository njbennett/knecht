159,open,Enhance beads2knecht to fully automate migration including cleanup,"Currently beads2knecht only converts .beads/beads to .knecht/tasks format. It should be a complete migration tool that: 1) Creates .knecht directory if needed, 2) Converts tasks and writes to .knecht/tasks, 3) Removes .beads directory after successful migration, 4) Optionally updates .rules files to remove beads references. Could be implemented as: (a) Enhanced beads2knecht with --full-migration flag, (b) Separate migration script that calls beads2knecht, or (c) New 'knecht migrate' command. Pain: User ran migration manually and it left .beads directory behind requiring manual cleanup.",,
