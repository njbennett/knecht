152,done,"Add post-commit hook to rebuild knecht binary after commits -d Problem: After committing changes to knecht source, the installed binary becomes stale, causing issues like task-150 where commands exist in source but not in the installed binary. Solution: Create a post-commit hook that automatically runs 'cargo build --release' and optionally copies the binary to the install location. This ensures the installed binary stays in sync with the source code during development. Implementation considerations: 1) Should it rebuild both knecht and beads2knecht? 2) Should it auto-install or just notify? 3) Should it be fast (cargo build) or optimized (cargo build --release)? 4) Add to .git/hooks/post-commit with instructions in README for developers to enable it.",,1,
