161,open,Agent misunderstood task-8 completion state,"Problem: User said 'I tried the migration. It mostly worked, but...' and agent interpreted this as 'let's start task-8' instead of 'task-8 is done, here are issues to track.' User had to explicitly say 'No, the automation part would be a new task. I think we've completed task-8.' Agent should recognize 'I tried X, it mostly worked' as indicating X is complete. This may be a knecht UX issue - should there be a command like 'knecht report task-N' that helps agents understand when users are reporting completion vs requesting work?",,
