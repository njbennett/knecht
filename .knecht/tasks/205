205,done,Replace manual CLI parsing with clap,"Currently we manually parse arguments for ~10 commands with custom logic in each cmd_* function. This leads to inconsistent UX, manual error handling, and duplicated parsing patterns. Replace with clap's derive API to get: automatic help text, better error messages, type-safe argument handling, and consistent interface across all commands. This will reduce code and improve maintainability.",,
