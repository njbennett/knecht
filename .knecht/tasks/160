160,open,Migration produces nonsense in .rules by replacing 'bd' with 'knecht',"Problem: The storytime migration replaced all instances of 'bd' with 'knecht' in the .rules file, producing nonsense instructions (e.g., 'knecht' appearing mid-word or in wrong contexts). The migration should intelligently handle .rules files by: 1) Deleting beads-specific sections entirely rather than find/replace, 2) Adding knecht-specific guidance if needed, 3) Preserving non-beads content unchanged. This is related to task-159 (full migration automation). The migration tool needs to understand structured edits to .rules files, not just blind text replacement. Pain: User discovered nonsense instructions in storytime .rules after migration.",,
